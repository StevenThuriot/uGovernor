{"name":"µGovernor","tagline":"a µTorrent cli","body":"# Usage\r\n\r\nµGovernor supports both authenticating using a webtoken or not. For security reasons, it's advised to keep the webtoken turned on.\r\n\r\nA few settings will always need to be passed to µGovernor:\r\n- The username\r\n- The password\r\n- And obviously: the hostname.\r\n\r\nSince it wouldn't be secure keeping these in the \"run program\" feature of µTorrent, µGovernor supports saving these in an AES-256 encrypted file. The file is encrypted using a fingerprint built from your pc's specs, so it can only be decompiled on your own hardware, keeping your settings safe.\r\n\r\nCreate such a file can be done using the cli:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuGovernor -save user USERNAME password PASSWORD host http://HOSTNAME:PORT\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the file is created, it won't be necesairy anymore to pass these settings to the cli. If you do pass any of these settings, they will overule the ones in the config file (e.g. for temporarely logging into a different server than your default one).\r\n\r\nAfter this, the cli can be used by passing it startup arguments, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuGovernor -start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will start all the torrents currently in your list.\r\n\r\n# Available Commands\r\nThe following actions can be used:\r\n\r\n## -host [VALUE]\r\nSets the server to connect to. \r\ne.g. `-host http://myserver.com:8080/`\r\nIt's not necessairy to add `/gui/`, but won't hurt either if you do.\r\n\r\n##-user [VALUE]\r\nSets the username to log in with.\r\n\r\n##-password [VALUE]\r\nSets the password to log in with.\r\n\r\n##-hash [VALUE]\r\nSets the torrent hash we want to use our passed commands on. When ommited, the cli will execute the commands on all torrents currently in the list.\r\n\r\nThis command can be used multiple times when you want to use the same command on several hashes at once.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuGovernor -start -hash HASH1 -hash HASH2\r\n```\r\n\r\n##-noTokenAuth\r\nDisables token auth, when you have disabled it in the webgui as well. \r\nStrongly advised not to do this!\r\n\r\n##-debug\r\nAll actions will be written/appended to debug.log\r\n\r\n##-ui\r\nShows a console UI. When started from a console, it will attach to parent instead.\r\n\r\n##-list[public|private]\r\nList all torrents and their hashes. A filter can be used (public or private). The filter is optional. Not supplying it will result in all torrents being printed.\r\n\r\nWhen `-ui` is not supplied, it will try to open a UI or attach to a parent UI anyway.\r\n\r\n##-start[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nStart the torrent\r\n\r\n##-stop[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nStop the torrent\r\n\r\n##-forcestart[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nForce Start the torrent\r\n\r\n##-pause[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nPause the torrent\r\n\r\n##-unpause[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nUnpause the torrent\r\n\r\n##-recheck[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nRecheck the torrent\r\n\r\n##-remove[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nRemove the torrent from the list. This will use your default removal setting.\r\n\r\n##-removeData[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nRemove both the torrent and the data from the list.\r\n\r\n##-label[_ifprivate|_ifpublic] [VALUE]\r\nSet the passed label to the torrent. If it doesn't exist yet, it will be created.\r\n\r\n##-removeLabel[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]\r\nRemove the torrent's label.\r\n\r\n##-setPrio[_ifprivate|_ifpublic] [VALUE]\r\nSet the torrents priority.\r\n\r\n##-setProperty[_ifprivate|_ifpublic] [NAME] [VALUE]\r\nA sort of catch all command. When wanting to set any property, e.g. download path.\r\n\r\n##-save [NAME] [VALUE] [NAME2] [VALUE2] .... [NAME_N] [VALUE_N]\r\nSecurely saves the passed values to a file.\r\nCurrently, only user, password and host are used.\r\n\r\nWhen adding or changing a property, it is not needed to supply all the previously saved (unaltered) properties again. If the property already existed in the file, it will be overridden, if not, it will be added. If you want a certain property deleted, you'll have to fully recreate the `cfg` file.\r\n\r\n##-add [HASH]\r\nAdd a torrent to the list by passing a hash. The torrent will be resolved using a magnet link.\r\n\r\n##-addResolved [HASH]\r\nAdd a torrent to the list by passing a hash. The torrent will be resolved using torcache.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Private and Public Torrents\r\n\r\nAll commands that have the `[_ifprivate|_ifpublic]` are in fact, three forms of that command, e.g:\r\n\r\nThis command will start all torrents in the list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuGovernor -start\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this command will only start the private torrents in the list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuGovernor -start_ifprivate\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, this command will start all the public torrents in the list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuGovernor -start_ifpublic\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Combining Commands\r\n\r\n.. is also a possibility!\r\n\r\nFor instance, we can stop all public torrents, start all private ones, remove all labels from the public ones, set a label to all private ones and recheck all of them, wether they are public or not.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuGovernor -stop_ifpublic -start_ifprivate -removeLabel_ifpublic -label_ifprivate MyLabel -recheck\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Legal Information\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
